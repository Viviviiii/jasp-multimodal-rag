🧪 Statistical Analysis

How do I run a repeated measures ANOVA in JASP?

How to perform a Bayesian ANOVA and interpret Bayes Factors?

Why are SPSS and JASP giving different ANOVA results?

Is it possible to run a confirmatory factor analysis in JASP?

How can I add a covariate in repeated measures ANOVA?

How to perform mediation or moderation analysis in JASP?

What is the difference between ANCOVA and repeated measures with a covariate?

Why does JASP use z-tests instead of t-tests in the Process module?

How to interpret the Bayes factor in Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA?

How to perform equivalence tests or pairwise comparisons in JASP?

Reason: These cover the full spectrum — t-tests, ANOVA, Bayesian methods, regression/mediation, and cross-software consistency, which dominate forum discussions.



🧩 Data Management in JASP

How to import data from Excel or CSV into JASP?

Why does JASP misclassify variable types after import?

How to compute or transform new variables (e.g., mean score)?

How to deal with missing data in ANOVA or chi-square tests?

How to reshape data from wide to long format?

Why does my dataset not show categorical factors correctly?

How to filter rows or select specific cases in JASP?

How to merge two datasets or append variables?

How to handle missing values before running tests?

Why are my variable labels lost after importing from SPSS?

Reason: These represent pre-analysis data preparation issues, very common for JASP users transitioning from Excel/SPSS.




⚙️ Technical / Software Issues

JASP won’t start after updating to version 0.19.1.

JASP crashes when opening a .jasp file.

Error loading “Descriptives” or other modules in JASP.

Antivirus (AVAST) flags libRinside.dll as a virus after update.

Why can’t I install JASP on macOS Ventura?

JASP freezes when running Bayesian ANOVA.

Compatibility issue: opening .jasp from 0.19.0 in 0.19.1.

Where should libRinside.dll normally be stored?

Why does JASP fail to load the SEM module?

JASP output disappears after reopening the file.

Reason: These are classic troubleshooting posts and installation issues, frequent in new versions and Windows setups.






📊 Visualization & Output

How to export plots from JASP to high resolution images?

How to generate APA-style tables in JASP?

Why doesn’t the interaction plot appear in ANOVA output?

How to create a raincloud plot in JASP?

How to change color schemes or axis labels in plots?

Can I adjust figure size before export?

How to customize the appearance of forest plots?

Why are plots missing in my saved .jasp file?

How to visualize correlations in JASP?

How to combine multiple plots in one figure?

Reason: Visualization and reporting requests are common as users prepare manuscripts or presentations.




🧠 Interpretation & Reporting

How to interpret results of Bayesian mixed models?

What does a Bayes factor of 3.2 mean?

Why do JASP and SPSS show different p-values?

How to report Bayesian t-test results in APA format?

How to interpret partial eta-squared in ANOVA?

How to interpret main effects and interactions in rmANOVA?

Why is my F-test significant but no pairwise comparisons are?

How to interpret standardized estimates in mediation SEM?

What does the difference between BF10 and BF01 mean?

How to describe posterior probability results in Bayesian models?

Reason: Interpretation dominates intermediate-level forum discussions, reflecting user uncertainty about statistical meaning and reporting.



📚 Learning / Conceptual Struggles

What analysis should I use for my data?

What is the difference between one-way and repeated measures ANOVA?

How to understand what a Bayes factor means?

When should I use regression instead of correlation?

How to know if my data meets ANOVA assumptions?

Why do my results change when I rerun the analysis?

What’s the difference between within- and between-subject factors?

Why are my results different from a textbook example?

What does “posterior probability” mean in JASP output?

How to interpret an interaction effect conceptually?

Reason: These represent cognitive/statistical learning gaps rather than software issues.



💡 Feature Requests / Philosophy

Will JASP support mediation analysis in the future?

Why does JASP use Cauchy priors by default?

Can JASP integrate with R or JAMOVI modules?

Can you add survival analysis or path analysis?

Why is effect size not shown by default in t-tests?

Can we change the prior settings globally in JASP?

Will JASP allow scripting or automation in future versions?

Why does JASP only show descriptive plots for some tests?

Can I set my own significance threshold by default?

Reason: These reflect advanced users or educators who engage with JASP’s design and future roadmap.



❓ Other / Ambiguous

I can’t reproduce results from a published paper using JASP.

My data look strange — can someone help?

I have a question about JASP output.

Something went wrong but I don’t know what.
