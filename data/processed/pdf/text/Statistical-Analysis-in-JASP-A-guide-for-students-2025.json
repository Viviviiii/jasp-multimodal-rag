    "text": "This can be defined as the tendency for variable values to cluster around a central value. The three\nways of describing this central value are mean, median and mode. If the whole population is\nconsidered, the term population mean / median/mode is used. If a sample/subset of the population\nis being analysed, the term sample mean/ median/mode is used. The measures of central tendency\nmove toward  a constant value when the sample size is sufficient to be representative of  the\npopulation.\n\nThe mean, M or x (17.71), is equal to the sum of all the values divided by the number of values in the\ndataset, i.e. the average of the values. It is used for describing continuous data. It provides a simple\nstatistical model of the centre of distribution of the values and is a theoretical estimate of the typical\nvalue. However, it can be influenced heavily by extreme scores.\nThe median, Mdn (17.9), is the middle value in a dataset that has been ordered from the smallest to\nthe largest value and is the normal measure used for ordinal or non-parametric continuous data. Less\nsensitive to outliers and skewed data\nThe mode (20.0) is the most frequent value in the dataset and is usually the highest bar in a distribution\nhistogram.\nDISPERSION\nThe standard error of the mean, SE  (0.244), is a measure of how far the sample mean of the data is\nexpected to be from the true population mean. As the size of the sample data grows larger , the SE\ndecreases compared to S, and the true mean of the population is known with greater specificity.\nStandard deviation, S or SD (6.935), is used to quantify the amount of dispersion of data values around\nthe mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values are close to the mean, while a high\nstandard deviation indicates that the values are dispersed over a wider range.\n\nThe coefficient of variation  (0.392) provides the relative dispersion of the data, in contrast to the\nstandard deviation, which gives the absolute dispersion.\nMAD, (4.7) median absolute deviation, a robust measure of the spread of data. It is relatively\nunaffected by data that is not normally distributed. Reporting median +/ - MAD for data that is not\nnormally distributed is equivalent to mean +/- SD for normally distributed data.\nMAD Robust : (6.968) m edian absolute deviation of the data points, adjusted by a factor for\nasymptotically normal consistency.\nIQR (9.175)  Interquartile Range is similar to the MAD but is less robust (see Boxplots).\nVariance (48.1) is another estimate of how far the data is spread from the mean. It is also the square\nof the standard deviation.\nConfidence intervals (CI), although not shown in the general Descriptive statistics output, are used in\nmany other statistical tests. When sampling from a population to get an estimate of the mean,\nconfidence intervals are a range of values within which you are n% confident the true  mean is\nincluded. A 95% CI is, therefore, a range of values that one can be 95% certain contains the true mean\nof the population. This is not the same as a range that contains 95% of ALL the values.\nFor example, in a normal distribution, 95% of the data are expected to be within  1.96 SD of the mean\nand 99% within  2.576 SD.\n95% CI = M  1.96 * the standard error of the mean.\nBased on the data so far, M = 17.71, SE = 0.24; this will be 17.71  (1.96 * 0.24) or 17.71  0.47.\nTherefore, the 95% CI for this dataset is 17.24 - 18.18 and suggests that the true mean is likely to be\nwithin this range 95% of the time\nQUARTILES\nIn the Statistics options, make sure that everything is unticked apart from Quartiles.\n\nQuartiles are where datasets are split into 4 equal quarters, normally based on the rank ordering of\nmedian values. For example, in this dataset\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 10 10\n25%     50%     75%\nThe median value that splits the data by 50% = 50th percentile = 5\nThe median value of left side = 25th percentile = 3\nThe median value of right side = 75th percentile = 8\nFrom this, the Interquartile range (IQR) can be calculated, which is the difference between the 75th\nand 25th percentiles, i.e. 5.  These values are used to construct the descriptive box  plots later.  The\nIQR can also be shown by ticking this option in the Dispersion menu.\nDISTRIBUTION\nSkewness describes the shift of the distribution away from a normal distribution. Negative skewness\nshows that the mode moves to the right, resulting in a dominant left tail. Positive skewness shows\nthat the mode moves to the left, resulting in a dominant right tail.\nNegative skewness\nPositive skewness\n\nKurtosis describes how heavy or light the tails are. Positive kurtosis results in an increase in the\npointiness of the distribution with heavy (longer) tails, while negative kurtosis exhibits a much more\nuniform or flatter distribution with light (shorter) tails.\nIn the Statistics options, make sure that everything is unticked apart from skewness, kurtosis and the\nShapiro-Wilk test.\nWe can use the Descriptives output to calculate skewness and kurtosis. For a normal data distribution,\nboth values should be close to zero. The Shapiro -Wilk test is used to assess whether the da ta is\nsignificantly different f rom a normal distribution.  (see - Exploring data integrity in JASP for more\ndetails).\nINFERENCE\nConfidence intervals provide a measure of how the data sample represents the population being\nstudied. The probability that the confidence interval includes the true mean of the population is\ntermed the confidence level and is typically set at 95%.\n+ kurtosis\nNormal\n- kurtosis",

As mentioned before, the highest bar is the mode (the most frequent value of\nthe dataset. In this case, the curve looks approximately symmetrical , suggesting that the data is\napproximately normally distributed. The second distribution plot is from another dataset , which\nshows that the data is positively skewed.\nThe dot plot displays the distribution where each dot represents a value. If a value occurs more than\nonce, the dots are placed one above the other so that the height of the column of dots represents the\nfrequency for that value.\nThe interval plot shows a 95% confidence interval for the mean of each variable.\nThe Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) can be used to visually assess if a set of data comes from a normal\ndistribution. Q -Q plots take the sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot  it against\nquantiles (percentiles) calculated from a theoretical distribution. If the data is normally distributed,\nthe points will fall on or close to the 45-degree reference line. If the data is not normally distributed,\nthe points will deviate from the reference line.\n\nDepending on the data sets, basic correlation graphs and pie charts for non-scale data can also be\nproduced, as can Pareto and Likert plots.",

Normality can be explored in a variety of\nways:\nNumerically\nVisually / graphically\nStatistically\nNumerically, we can use the Descriptives output to calculate skewness and kurtosis. For a normal data\ndistribution, both values should be close to zero. To determine the significance of skewness or\nkurtosis, we calculate their z-scores by dividing them by their associated standard errors:\nSkewness Z =\nskewness\nSkewness standard error          Kurtosis Z =\nkurtosis\nkurtosis standard error\nZ score significance: p<0.05 if z >1.96        p<0.01 if z >2.58      p<0.001 if z >3.29\n\nUsing Exploring data.csv, go to Descriptives>Descriptive Statistics move Variable 3 to the Variables\nbox, in the Statistics drop -down menu select Mean, Std Deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis as shown\nbelow with the corresponding output table.\nNeither skewness nor kurtosis is close to 0. The positive skewness suggests that the data is distributed\nmore on the left (see graphs later) , while the negative kurtosis suggests a flat distribution. When\ncalculating their z-scores, it can be seen that the data is significantly skewed, p<0.05.\nSkewness Z =\n0.839\n0.337     =   2.49    Kurtosis Z =\n-0.407\n0.662  = 0.614\n[As a note of caution, skewness and kurtosis may appear significant in large datasets even though the\ndistribution is normal.]\nNow add Variable 2 to the Variables box , and in Plots , tick Distribution plot.  This will show the\nfollowing two graphs:\n\nIt is quite easy to visualise that Variable 2 has a symmetrical distribution. Variable 3 is skewed to the\nleft, as confirmed by the skewness Z score.\nAnother graphical check for normality is a Q -Q plot.  Q-Q plots are available in Descriptives and are\nalso produced as part of the Assumption Checks used in linear regression and ANOVA. Q-Q plots show\nthe quantiles of the actual data against those expected for a normal distribution.\nIf the data are normally distributed , all the points will be close to the diagonal reference line. If the\npoints sag above or below the line , there is a problem with kurtosis. If the points snake around the\nline, then the problem is skewness.  Below are Q-Q plots for Variables 2 and 3.  Compare these to the\nprevious distribution plots and the skewness/kurtosis z scores above.\nThe following Q-Q plot scenarios are possible:\nVariable 2\nVariable 3\n\nThe Shapiro-Wilk test is a statistical test used by JASP to check the assumption of normality.  It is also\nused in the Independent (distribution of the two groups) and Paired (distribution of differences\nbetween pairs) t-tests. The test results in a W value, where small values indicate your sample is not\nnormally distributed (the null hypothesis that your population is normally distributed , if your values\nare under a certain threshold, can, therefore, be rejected).\nIn Descriptives, the Shapiro -Wilk test can be selected in the Distribution tests.  The Shapiro-Wilk\noutput table show s no significant deviation in normality for Variable 2 but a significant deviation\n(p<.001) for Variable 3.\nThe most important limitation is that the test can be biased by sample size. The larger the sample, the\nmore likely youll get a statistically significant result.\nTesting the assumption of normality  A cautionary note!\nFor most parametric tests to be reliable , one of the assumptions is that the data is approximately\nnormally distributed. A normal distribution peaks in the middle and is symmetrical about the mean.\nHowever, data does not need to be perfectly normally distributed for the tests to be reliable.\nSo, having gone on about testing for normality, is it necessary?\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that as the sample size gets larger , i.e. >30 data points , the\ndistribution of the sampling means approaches a normal distribution.  So the more data points you\nhave, the more normal the distribution will look and the closer your sample mean approximates the\npopulation mean.\nLarge datasets may result in significant tests of normality, i.e. Shapiro-Wilk or significant skewness and\nkurtosis z -scores when the distribution graphs look fairly normal.  Conversely, small datasets will\nreduce the statistical power to detect non-normality.\nHowever, data that does not meet the assumption of normality is going to result in poor results for\ncertain types of tests (i.e. ones that state that the assumption must be met!). How closely does your\ndata need to be normally distributed? This is a judgment call best made by eyeballing the data.",

A small p -value, <0.05 in most\nanalyses, provides evidence against the null hypothesis , whereas a large p -value >0.05 only means\nthat there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A lower p -value is sometimes\nincorrectly interpreted as meaning there is a stronger relationship or difference between variables. So\nwhat is needed is not just null hypothesis testing but also a method of determining precisely how large\nthe effects seen in the data are.\nAn effect size is a statistical measure used to determine the strength of the relationship or difference\nbetween variables.  Unlike a p-value, effect sizes can be used to quantitatively compare the results\nof different studies.\nFor example, comparing heights between 11 and 12-year-old children may show that the 12-year-\nolds are significantly taller, but it is difficult to visually see a difference, i.e. small effect size.\nHowever, a significant difference in height between 11 and 16-year-old children is obvious (large\neffect size).\nThe effect size is usually measured in three ways:\nThe standardised mean difference\ncorrelation coefficient\nodds ratio\nWhen looking at differences between groups, most techniques are primarily based on the differences\nbetween the means divided by the average standard deviations. The values derived can then be used\nto describe the magnitude of the differences.  The effect sizes calculated in JASP for t-tests and ANOVA\nare shown below:\n\nWhen analysing bivariate or multivariate relationships, the effect sizes are the correlation\ncoefficients:\nWhen analysing categorical relationships via contingency tables , i.e. chi-square test, Phi is only used\nfor 2x2 tables while Cramers V and be used for any table size.\nFor a 2  2 contingency table, we can also define the odds ratio measure of effect size.",

    "text": "Correlation is a statistical technique that can be used to determine if, and how strongly, pairs of\nvariables are associated.  Correlation is only appropriate for quantifiable data in which numbers are\nmeaningful, such as continuous or ordinal data. It cannot be used for purely categorical data, for which\nwe have to use contingency table analysis (see Chi-square analysis in JASP).\nEssentially, do different variables co-vary? i.e. are changes in one variable reflected in similar changes\nto another variable?  If one variable deviates from its mean , does the other variable deviate from its\nmean in either the same or opposite direction?  This can be assessed by measuring covariance ;\nhowever, this is not standardised. For example, we can measure the covariance of two variables that\nare measured in meters ; however, if we convert the same values to centimetres, we get the same\nrelationship but with a completely different covariance value.\nTo overcome this, standardised covariance is used , which is known as Pearsons correlation\ncoefficient (or \"r\"). It ranges from -1.0 to +1.0. The closer r is to +1 or -1, the more closely the two\nvariables are related. If r is close to 0, there is no relationship. If r is (+), then as one variable increases,\nthe other also increases. If r is (-), then as one increases, the other decreases (sometimes referred to\nas an \"inverse\" correlation).\nThe correlation coefficient (r) should not be confused with R 2 (coefficient of determination) or R\n(multiple correlation coefficient as used in the regression analysis).\nThe main assumption in this analysis is that the data have a normal distribution and are linear. This\nanalysis will not work well with curvilinear relationships.\nCovariance = 4.7 Covariance = 470",

Both are based on\nranking data and are not affected by outliers or normality/variance violations.\nSpearman's rho is usually used for ordinal scale data , and Kendall's tau is used in small samples or\nwhen many values with the same score (ties). In most cases, Kendalls tau and Spearmans rank\ncorrelation coefficients are very similar and thus invariably lead to the same inferences.\nThe effect sizes are the same as Pearsons r. The main difference is that rho 2 can be used as an\napproximate non-parametric coefficient of determination, but the same is not true for Kendalls tau.\nFrom the example data, open Non-parametric correlation.csv, which contains 2 columns of data, a\ncreativity score and position in the Worlds biggest liar competition (thanks to Andy Field).\nRun the analysis as before , but now using Spearman and Kendalls tau -b coefficients instead of\nPearsons.",

    "text": "The correlation only gives information on the strength of association. It gives no information on the\ndirection, i.e. which variable causes the other to change. So, it cannot be used to state that one thing\ncauses the other.  Often , a significant correlation means absolutely nothing and is purely by chance ,\nespecially if you correlate thousands of variables. This can be seen in the following strange\ncorrelations:\nPedestrians killed in a collision with a railway train correlate with rainfall in Missouri:\nThe number of honey-producing bee colonies (1000s) correlates strongly with the marriage rate in\nSouth Carolina (per 1000 marriages)\n\nREGRESSION\nWhereas correlation tests for associations between variables, regression is the next step commonly\nused for predictive analysis, i.e. to predict a dependent outcome variable from one (simple regression)\nor more (multiple regression) independent predictor variables.\nRegression results in a hypothetical model of the relationship between the outcome and predictor\nvariable(s).  The model used is a linear one defined by the formula;\ny = c + b*x +\ny = estimated dependent outcome variable score,\nc = constant,\nb = regression coefficient and\nx = score on the independent predictor variable\n= random error component (based on residuals)\nLinear regression provides both the constant and regression coefficient(s).\nLinear regression makes the following assumptions:\nData (1 dependent variable of continuous level, independent variables that are measured\neither at the continuous or nominal level, sample size, etc.)\nOutliers, there should be no significant outliers, high-leverage points or highly influential\npoints.\nLinear relationship, there needs to be a linear relationship between (a) the dependent\nvariable and each of your independent variables, and (b) the dependent variable and the\nindependent variables collectively.\nIndependence, there should be independence of observations (i.e., independence of\nresiduals)\nNormality, a) check that the residuals (errors) are approximately normally distributed; and\nb) check that the dependent variable is approximately normally distributed.\nEqual error variances, data needs to show homoscedasticity of residuals (equal error\nvariances)\nMulticollinearity,  data must show minimal multicollinearity. This occurs when you have\ntwo or more independent variables that are highly correlated with each other.\nConcerning sample sizes, there are many different rules of thumb in the literature, ranging from 10-\n15 data points per predictor in the model, i.e. 4 predictor variables will each require between 40 and\n60 data points each, to 50 +(8 * number of predictors) for each variable. So, for 4 variables, that would\nrequire 82 data point s for each variable. Effectively , the bigger your sample size , the better your\nmodel.\n\nSUMS OF SQUARES (Boring, but the basis of evaluating the regression model.)\nMost regression analyses will produce the best model available, but how good is it actually, and how\nmuch error is in the model?\nThis can be determined by looking at the goodness of fit using the sums of squares. This is a measure\nof how close the actual data points are to the modelled regression line.\nThe vertical difference between the data points and the predicted regression line is known as the\nresiduals. These values are squared to remove the negative numbers and then summed to give SSR.\nThis is effectively the error of the model or the goodness of fit, obviously, the smaller the value, the\nless error in the model.\nValues above the\nline are positive\nValues below the\nline are negative\n\nThe vertical difference between the data points and the mean of the outcome variable can be\ncalculated. These values are squared to remove the negative numbers and then summed to give the\ntotal sum of the squares , SST. This shows how good the mean value is as a model of the outcome\nscores.\nThe vertical difference between the mean of the outcome variable and the predicted regression line\nis now determine d. Again, these values are squared to remove the negative numbers and then\nsummed to give the model sum of squares (SSM). This indicates how better the model is compared to\njust using the mean of the outcome variable. SST is the total sum of the squares.\nSo, the larger the SSM, the better the model is at predicting the outcome compared to the mean value\nalone. If this is accompanied by a small SSR, the model also has a small error.\nR2 is similar to the coefficient of determination in correlation in that it shows how much of the\nvariation in the outcome variable can be predicted by the predictor variable(s).\n$$R^2 = \\frac{SS_M}{SS_T}$$\nSST\nIn regression, the model is assessed by the F statistic based on the improvement in the prediction of\nthe model SSM and the residual error SSR.  The larger the F value, the better the model.\n$$F = \\frac{Mean\\ SS_M}{Mean\\ SS_R}$$\nMean SSR",

Even though the ANOVA shows the\nmodel to be significant, none of the predictor regression coefficients is significant!\n\nThe casewise diagnostics table is empty! This is good news. This will highlight any  cases (rows) that\nhave residuals that are 3 or more standard deviations away from the mean. These cases with the\nlargest errors may well be outliers. Too many outliers will have an impact on the model and should be\ndealt with in the usual way (see Exploring Data Integrity).\nAs a comparison, re-run the analyses but now choose Backwards as the method of data entry.\nThe outputs are as follows:\nJASP has now calculated 4 potential regression models.  It can be seen that each consecutive model\nincreases the adjusted R2, with model 4 accounting for 73.5% of the outcome variance.\nThe Durbin-Watson score is also higher than the forced entry method.\nThe ANOVA table indicates that each successive model is better , as shown by the increasing F -value\nand improving p-value.\n\nModel 1 is the same as the forced entry method first used.  The table shows that as the least\nsignificantly contributing predictors are sequentially removed, we end up with a model with two\nsignificant predictor regression coefficients, right leg strength and bilateral leg strength.\nWe can now report the Backwards predictor entry results in a highly significant model F(2, 10) = 17.92,\np<.001 and a regression equation of\nDistance = 46.251 + (3.914 * R_Strength) + (2.009 * Bilateral Strength)",

    "text": "The initial output should comprise 4 tables.\nThe model summary shows that H1 (with the lowest AIC and BIC scores) suggests a significant\nrelationship ( X2(37) = 21.257, p<.001) between the outcome (2 nd heart attack) and the predictor\nvariables (exercise prescription and stress levels).\nMcFadden's R2 = 0.383. It is suggested that a range from 0.2 to 0.4 indicates a good model fit.\n\nBoth stress level and exercise prescription are significant predictor variables (p=.031 and .022,\nrespectively). The most important values in the coefficients table are the odds ratios. For the\ncontinuous predictor, an odds ratio of greater than 1 suggests a positive relationship, while < 1\nimplies a negative relationship. This suggests that high-stress levels are significantly related to an\nincreased probability of having a second heart attack.\nThus, the odds ratio of 1.093 means that for each additional point on the stress scale, the odds of\nhaving a second heart attack are increased 1.1 times. Or presented in percentage, for every\nadditional point on the stress scale, the odds of having a second heart attack increase by 9.3%.\nThe odds ratio of 0.130 regarding the ex ercise prescription variable can be interpreted as having a\nsecond heart attack undergoing an exercise intervention is 0.13 times the odds of not having such an\nintervention. Or presented in percentage, those having exercise prescription are 87% less likely to\nhave a second heart attack compared to those not having such an intervention.\nThe confusion matrix shows (where agreement (yes/yes) or disagreement (yes/no) occurred between\nthe predicted and observed) that the 15 true negative and positive cases were predicted by the model,\nwhile the error, false negatives and positives, were found in 5 cases.  This is confirmed in the\nPerformance metrics, where both sensitivity (% of cases that had the outcome correctly predicted)\nand specificity (% of cases correctly predicted as not having the outcome (i.e., true negatives) are both\n75%.\nPLOTS\nThese findings can be easily visualised through the inferential plots.\n\nAs stress levels increase, the probability of having a second heart attack increases.\nNo exercise intervention increases the probability of a 2nd heart attack, while it is reduced when it has\nbeen put in place.",

    "text": "ANOVA\nWhereas t-tests compare the means of two groups/conditions, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\ncompares the means of 3 or more groups/conditions. There are both independent and repeated\nmeasures ANOVAs available in JASP. ANOVA has been described as an omnibus test which results in\nan F-statistic that compares whether the dataset 's overall explained variance is significantly greater\nthan the unexplained variance. The null hypothesis tested is that  there is no significant difference\nbetween the means of all the groups. If the null hypothesis is rejected, ANOVA just states that there\nis a significant difference between the groups, but not where those differences occur.  To determine\nwhere the group differences are, post hoc (From the Latin post hoc, \"after this\") tests are subsequently\nused.\nWhy not just multiple pairwise comparisons? If there are 4 groups (A, B, C, D) , for example and the\ndifferences were compared using multiple t-tests:\nA vs. B  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nA vs. C  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nA vs. D  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nB vs. C  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nB vs. D  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nC vs. D  P<0.05   95% no type I error\nAssuming that each test was independent, the overall probability would be:\n0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.735\nThis is known as familywise error or, cumulative Type I error, and in this case , results in only a 73.5%\nprobability of no Type I error whereby the null hypothesis could be rejected when it is true. This is\novercome by using post hoc tests that make multiple pairwise comparisons with stricter acceptance\ncriteria to prevent familywise error.\nASSUMPTIONS\nThe independent ANOVA makes the same assumptions as most other parametric tests.\nThe independent variable must be categorical, and the dependent variable must be\ncontinuous.\nThe groups should be independent of each other.\nThe dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed.\nThere should be no significant outliers.\nThere should be homogeneity of variance between the groups; otherwise, the p-value for the\nF-statistic may not be reliable.\nThe first 2 assumptions are usually controlled using an appropriate research method design.\nIf the last three assumptions are violated, then the non-parametric equivalent, Kruskal-Wallis, should\nbe considered instead.\n\nCONTRASTS\nContrasts are a priori tests (i.e. planned comparisons before any data were collected). As an\nexample, researchers may want to compare the effects of some new drugs to the currently\nprescribed ones. These should only be a small set of comparisons to reduce family-wise error.\nThe choice must be based on the scientific questions being asked and chosen during the\nexperimental design. Hence, the term planned comparisons.   Therefore, they are looking at\nspecified mean differences and can be used if the ANOVA F test is insignificant.\nJASP provides 6 planned contrasts enabling different types of comparisons:\nDeviation: the mean of each level of the independent variable is compared to the overall\nmean (the mean when all the levels are taken together).\nSimple: the mean of each level is compared to the mean of a specified level, for example, with\nthe mean of the control group.\nDifference: the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the previous levels.\nHelmert: the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the subsequent levels.\nRepeated: By selecting this contrast, the mean of each level is compared to the mean of the\nfollowing level.2\nPolynomial: tests polynomial trends in the data.",

    "text": "RMANOVA\nThe one-way repeated measures ANOVA ( RMANOVA) is used to assess if there is a difference in\nmeans between 3 or more groups (where the participants are the same in each group) that have been\ntested multiple times or under different conditions. Such a research design, for example, could be that\nthe same participants were tested for an outcome measure at 1, 2 and 3 weeks or that the outcome\nwas tested under conditions 1, 2 and 3.\nThe null hypothesis tested is that  there is no significant difference between the means of the\ndifferences between all the groups.\nThe independent variable should be categorical, and the dependent variable needs to be a continuous\nmeasure. In this analysis , the independent categories are termed levels, i.e. these are the related\ngroups. So in the case where an outcome was measured at weeks 1, 2 and 3, the 3 levels would be\nweek 1, week 2 and week 3.\nThe F-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean squares for the variable (variance explained by the\nmodel) by its error mean squares (unexplained variance). The larger the F -statistic, the more likely it\nis that the independent variable will have had a significant effect on the dependent variable.\nASSUMPTIONS\nThe RMANOVA makes the same assumptions as most other parametric tests.\nThe dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed.\nThere should be no significant outliers.\nSphericity relates to the equality of the variances of the differences between levels of the\nrepeated measures factor.\nIf the assumptions are violated , then the non -parametric equivalent, Friedmans test, should be\nconsidered instead and is described later in this section.\nSPHERICITY\nIf a study has 3 levels (A, B and C), sphericity assumes the following:\nVariance (A-B)  Variance (A-C)  Variance (B-C)\nRMANOVA checks the assumption of sphericity using Mauchlys (pronounced Mockleys) test of\nsphericity. This tests the null hypothesis that the variances of the differences are equal .  In many\ncases, repeated measures violate the assumption of sphericity , which can lead to Type I error. If this\nis the case, corrections to the F-statistic can be applied.\nJASP offers two methods of correcting the F -statistic, the Greenhouse-Geisser and the Huynh-Feldt\nepsilon () corrections. A general rule of thumb is that if the  values are <0.75 , then use the\nGreenhouse-Geisser correction and if they are >0.75 then use the Huynh-Feldt correction.",

    "text": "First, look at the Contingency table output.\nRemember that 2 tests are only valid when you have a reasonable sample size, i.e. less than 20% of\ncells have an expected count of less than 5, and none have an expected count of less than 1.\nFrom this table, looking at % within rows, more males died on the Titanic compared to females , and\nmore females survived compared to males. But is there a significant association between gender and\nsurvival?\nThe statistical results are shown below:\nThe 2 statistic (2 (1) = 365.9, p<.001) suggests that there is a significant association between gender\nand survival.\n2 continuity correction can be used to prevent the overestimation of statistical significance for small\ndatasets. This is mainly used when at least one cell of the table has an expected count smaller than 5.\n\nAs a note of caution , this correction may overcorrect and result in an overly conservative result that\nfails to reject the null hypothesis when it should (a type II error).\nThe likelihood ratio is an alternative to the Pearson chi-square. It is based on the maximum-likelihood\ntheory. For large samples, it is identical to Pearson 2. It is recommended for small sample sizes, i.e.\n<30.\nNominal measures, Phi (2 x 2 contingency tables only) and Cramer's V (most popular) are both tests\nof the strength of association (i.e. effect sizes). Both values are in the range of 0 (no association) to 1\n(complete association). The strength of association between the variables has a large effect size.\nThe Contingency coefficient is an adjusted Phi value and is only suggested for large contingency tables,\nsuch as 5 x 5 tables or larger.\nEffect size 4 df Small Moderate Large\nPhi and Cramers V (2x2 only) 1 0.1 0.3 0.5\nCramers V 2 0.07 0.21 0.35\nCramers V 3 0.06 0.17 0.29\nCramers V 4 0.05 0.15 0.25\nCramers V 5 0.04 0.13 0.22\nJASP also provides the Odds ratio (OR), which is used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence\nof the outcome of interest (survival), given exposure to the variable of interest (in this case, gender).\nIn Preferences, I suggest that you return the number of decimals to 3.\nFor ease of understanding, take the reciprocal of the OR (1/0.088), i.e. 11.36. This suggests that male\npassengers had 11.36 times more chance of dying than females.\n4 Kim HY.  Statistical notes for clinical researchers: Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Restor.

However, they will provide results\nsuch as:\nCentral tendencies and dispersion\nT or F statistics\nP-values\nCorrelation coefficients\nChi-square\nAll of these can be converted to an ES and the SE determined using JASP's Effect size computation ,\nwhich is described later.\nFor example, a study comparing a treatment to a control group may provide the variable mean, SD\nand n of each group. From this , the ES, a standardised mean difference (d) , and estimated standard\nerror can be calculated.\nTo interpret the meta -analysis output, one needs to understand the following concepts :\nheterogeneity, the model, effect size, and the forest plot.\nHeterogeneity:\nHeterogeneity describes any variability that may exist between the different studies.   It is the opposite\nof homogeneity, which means that the population/data/results are the same.  There are 3 types:\n\nClinical:   Differences in participants, interventions, or outcomes\nMethodological:  Differences in study design, risk of bias\nStatistical:   Variation in intervention effects or results\nIf there is no variability, then the data can be described as homogeneous.  Meta-analysis is concerned\nwith statistical heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity is used to describe variability among\ndata/studies and occurs when the treatment effect estimates of a set of data/studies vary among one\nanother.  Studies with methodological flaws and small studies may overestimate treatment effects\nand can contribute to statistical heterogeneity.\nThe diagram above5 shows examples of forest plots exhibiting low and high heterogeneity. In the low\ncondition, all the studies are generally lined up to the right of the vertical axis and all confidence\nintervals are overlapping. In the high condition, the studies are spread over either side of the vertical\ndecision line and there is little overlap of the confidence intervals. Apart from visual observation of\nMeta-analysis provides quantitative statistical methods to measure heterogeneity.\nTests for heterogeneity\nQ Cochran Q test - values are given for 2 tests outlined below, (these tests have low statistical\npower when only a few studies are included in the meta-analysis):\nTest for residual heterogeneity tests the null hypothesis that all the effect sizes in the studies\nare equal (homogeneity of effect sizes).\n2     Tau square is an estimate of the total amount of heterogeneity. This is interpreted as\nsystematic, unexplained differences between the observed effects of the separate studies. It\nis not affected by the number of studies, but it is often hard to interpret how relevant the\nvalue is from a practical standpoint.\nI2  This measures the extent of heterogeneity not caused by sampling error. If there is high\nheterogeneity, a possible subgroup analysis could be done. If the value is very low, there is no\npoint in doing further subgroup analyses. I 2  is not sensitive to changes in the number of\nstudies and is therefore used extensively in medical and psychological research, especially\nsince there is a rule of thumb to interpret it.  A rough guide for interpretations has been\nsuggested as follows6:\n0% to 40%: might not be important.\n30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity.\n50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity.\n75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.\n5 https://s4be.cochrane.org/blog/2018/11/29/what-is-heterogeneity/\n6 Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions\nLow\nheterogeneity\nHigh\nheterogeneity\n\nH2  The between-study variance is determined by equating the Q statistic to its expected value.\nH2 has a value of 1 in the case of homogeneity , and heterogeneity is assumed to be present\nwhen H2>1.\nMeta-analysis models\nThere are two models commonly used in meta -analysis, and each make s different assumptions\nrelating to the observed differences among the studies.\nFixed effects model : this assumes that all studies share a common true ES , i.e. the data is\nhomogeneous.  All factors that could influence the ES are the same in all the study samples , and\ntherefore very little heterogeneity. Between-study differences are assumed to be due to chance and\nthus not incorporated into the model. Therefore, each study included in the meta -analysis estimates\nthe same population treatment effect, which, in theory, represents the true population treatment\neffect. Each study is weighted where more weight is given to studies with large sample sizes, i.e. more\ninformation.\nThis model answers the following question: What is the best estimate of the population effect size?\nRandom effects model: This assumes a distribution of the treatment effect for some populations. i.e.\nthe different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. Therefore,\nheterogeneity cannot be explained because it is due to chance.  This model assigns a  more balanced\nweighting between studies.\nThis model answers the question What is the average treatment effect?.\nIt is therefore important to check for significant heterogeneity to\nselect the correct model for the meta-analysis.\nRandom effects model selection.\nJASP provides 8 random effects estimators to estimate the 4 indices of heterogeneity (see tests for\nheterogeneity above). All use a slightly different approach , resulting in different pooled ES\nestimates and CIs. To date, the most often used estimator in medical research is the\nDerSimonian-Laird estimator ; however, recent studies have shown better estimates of\nbetween-study variance using Maximum -Likelihood, Restricted ML  (Default in JASP ),\nEmpirical Bayes and Sidak-Jonkman methods.\nThe Forest Plot.\nThis plot provides a visual summary of the meta-analysis findings. Graphically, it represents the ES and\n95% CI for each study and an estimate of the overall ES and 95% CI for all the studies that were\nincluded.  As previously mentioned, it can be used to visually assess the level of heterogeneity.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if all the individual study CIs cover the final combined ES and its 95% CI (diamond),\nthen there is low heterogeneity (or high homogeneity). In this case, 6 studies do not intersect with the\ndiamond.\nFunnel plot\nLooking like an inverted funnel, this is a scatter plot of the intervention effect estimates from individual\nstudies against each studys size or precision. The intervention effect should increase as the size of the\nstudy increases. Studies with low power will cluster at the bottom, while higher power studies will be\nnear the top. Ideally, the data points should have a symmetrical distribution.  Funnel plot asymmetry\nindicates that the meta-analysis results may be biased. Potential reasons for bias include:\nPublication bias (the tendency of authors/publishers to only publish studies with significant\nresults)\nTrue heterogeneity\nArtefact (wrong choice of effect measure)\nData irregularities (methodological design, data analysis, etc.)\nFunnel plot asymmetry can be analysed statistically using either meta-regression, weighted regression\nor rank correlation.",

    "text": "The frequentist approach is the most commonly taught and used statistical methodology. It\ndescribes sample data based on the frequency or proportion of the data from repeated\nstudies through which the probability of events is defined.\nFrequentist statistics uses rigid frameworks including hypothesis testing, p values confidence\nintervals etc.\nHypothesis testing\nA hypothesis can be defined as  a supposition or proposed explanation made based on\nlimited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.\nThere are two simple types of hypotheses, a null hypothesis (H 0) and an alternative or\nexperimental hypothesis (H1). The null hypothesis is the default position for most statistical\nanalyses in which it is stated that there is no relationship or difference between groups.  The\nalternative hypothesis states that there is a relationship or difference between groups in a\ndirection of difference/relationship. For example, if a study was carried out to look at the\neffects of a supplement on sprint time in one group of participants compared to the placebo\ngroup:\nH0 = there is no difference in sprint times between the two groups\nH1 = there is a difference in sprint times between the two groups\nH2 = Group 1 is greater than Group 2\nH3 = Group 1 is less than Group 2\nHypothesis testing refers to the strictly predefined procedures used to accept or reject the\nhypotheses and the probability that this could be purely by chance . The confidence at which\na null hypothesis is accepted or rejected is called the level of significance. The level of\nsignificance is denoted by , usually 0.05 (5%). This is the level of probability of accepting an\neffect as true (95%) and that there is only 5% of the result is purely by chance.\nDifferent types of hypotheses can easily be selected in JASP, however, the null hypothesis is\nalways the default.\n\nType I and II errors\nThe probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, when it is , in fact, true, is called Type I error\nwhereas the probability of accepting the null hypothesis  when it is not true  is called Type II\nerror.\nThe truth\nNot guilty (H0) Guilty (H1)\nThe verdict\nGuilty (H1)\nType I error\nAn i nnocent person\ngoes to prison\nCorrect decision\nNot guilty (H0)\nCorrect decision\nType II error\nA guilty person goes free\nType I error is deemed the worst error to make in statistical analyses.\nStatistical power is defined as the probability that the test will reject the null hypothesis when\nthe alternative hypothesis is true. For a set level of significance, if the sample size  increases,\nthe probability of Type II error decreases, which therefore increases the statistical power.\nTesting the hypothesis\nThe essence of hypothesis testing is to first define the null (or alternative) hypothesis , set\nthe criterion level , usually 0.05 (5%), collect and analyse sample data. Use a test statistic to\ndetermine how far (or the number of standard deviations) the sample mean is from the\npopulation mean stated in the null hypothesis. The test statistic is then compared to a critical\nvalue. This is a cut-off value defining the boundary where less than 5% of the sample means\ncan be obtained if the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the probability of obtaining a difference between the means by chance is less than 5% when\nthe null hypothesis has been proposed, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative\nhypothesis can be accepted.\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining a sample outcome, given that the  value stated in\nthe null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than 5% (p < .05)  the null hypothesis  is\nrejected.  When the p-value is greater than 5% (p > .05), we accept the null hypothesis.\nEffect size\nAn effect size is a standard measure that can be calculated from any number of statistical\nanalyses. If the null hypothesis is rejected the result is significant.  This significance only\nevaluates the probability of obtaining the sample outcome by chance but does not indicate\nhow big a difference (practical significance) is, nor can it be used to compare across different\nstudies.\nThe effect size indicates the magnitude of the difference between the groups. So for example,\nif there was a significant decrease in 100m sprint times in a supplement compared to a\n\nplacebo group, the effect size would indicate how much more effective the intervention was.\nSome common effect sizes are shown below.\nTest Measure Trivial Small Medium Large\nBetween means Cohens d <0.2 0.2 0.5 0.8\nCorrelation Correlation coefficient (r)\nRank -biserial (rB)\nSpearmans rho\n<0.1\n<0.1\n<0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.3\n0.3\n0.3\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nMultiple Regression Multiple correlation\ncoefficient (R)\n<0.10 0.1 0.3 0.5\nANOVA Eta\nPartial Eta\nOmega squared\n<0.1\n<0.01\n<0.01\n0.1\n0.01\n0.01\n0.25\n0.06\n0.06\n0.37\n0.14\n0.14\nChi-squared Phi (2x2 tables only)\nCramers V\nOdds ratio (2x2 tables only)\n<0.1\n<0.1\n<1.5\n0.1\n0.1\n1.5\n0.3\n0.3\n3.5\n0.5\n0.5\n9.0\nIn small datasets, there may be a moderate to large effect size but no significant differences.\nThis could suggest that the analysis lacked statistical power and that increasing the number\nof data points may show a significant outcome. Conversely, when using large datasets,\nsignificant testing can be misleading since small or trivial effects may produce statistically\nsignificant results.\nPARAMETRIC vs NON-PARAMETRIC TESTING\nMost research collects information from a sample of the population of interest, it is normally\nimpossible to collect data from the whole population. We do, however, want to see how well\nthe collected data reflects the population in terms of the population mean, standard\ndeviations, proportions etc. based on parametric distribution functions.  These measures are\nthe population parameters. Parameter estimates of these in the sample population are\nstatistics. Parametric statistics require assumptions to be made of the data including the\nnormality of distribution and homogeneity of variance.\nIn some cases, these assumptions may be violated in that the data may be noticeably skewed:\n\nSometimes transforming the data can rectify this but not always. It is also common to collect\nordinal data (i.e. Likert scale ratings) for which terms such as mean and standard deviation\nare meaningless. As such there are no parameters associated with ordi nal (non-parametric)\ndata. The non-parametric counterparts include median values and quartiles.\nIn both of the cases described non -parametric statistical tests are available. There are\nequivalents to the most common classical parametric tests. These tests dont assume\nnormally distributed data  or population parameters and are based on sorting the data into\nranks from lowest to highest values.
