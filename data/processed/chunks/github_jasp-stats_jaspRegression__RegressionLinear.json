By default, the number of replications is set to 1000. This can be changed into the desired number. \n  - Confidence Intervals: By selecting this option, confidence intervals for the estimated mean difference will be included. By default the confidence level is set to 95%. This can be changed into the desired percentage. \n  - Tolerance and VIF: Display Tolerance and Variance Inflation Factor for each predictor in the model to assess multicollinearity.\n  - Vovk-Sellke Maximum *p*-Ratio: The bound 1/(-e *p* log(*p*)) is derived from the shape of the *p*-value distribution. Under the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) it is uniform(0,1), and under the alternative (H<sub>1</sub>) it is decreasing in *p*, e.g., a beta(&#945;, 1) distribution, where 0 < &#945; < 1. The Vovk-Sellke MPR is obtained by choosing the shape &#945; of the distribution under H<sub>1</sub> such that the obtained *p*-value is *maximally diagnostic*. The value is then the ratio of the densities at point *p* under H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>.\nFor example, if the two-sided *p*-value equals .05, the Vovk-Sellke MPR equals 2.46, indicating that this *p*-value is at most 2.46 times more likely to occur under H<sub>1</sub> than under H<sub>0</sub>.\n\n- Model Summary: \n  - R squared change: Change in R squared between the different steps in Backward, Forward, and Stepwise regression,  with corresponding significance test (i.e., df1, df2, p-value).\n  - F change: Change in F between the different steps in Backward, Forward, and Stepwise regression,  with corresponding significance test (i.e., df1, df2, p-value).",
