      "text": "Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models\n===\n\nBayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models allow you to model a linear relationship between one or more explanatory variable(s) and a continuous dependent variable in cases where the observations are not independent, but clustered given one or several random effects grouping factors (e.g., repeated measures across participants or items, children within schools). They are generalization of Bayesian Linear Mixed Models and allow to model response variables that are not continous using a different likelihoods and link functions.",

      "text": "### Assumptions\n- Linearity and additivity: The response variable is related to all predictors according to the link function and the effects of the predictors are additive on the linear scale.\n- Independence of errors: The errors are uncorrelated with each other after taking the model (i.e., fixed effects and random effects structure) into account.\n- Homoscedasticity: The error variance of each predictor is constant across all values of that predictor.\n- Distribution of errors: The errors are distributed according to the distributional family.\n\nThe analysis uses orthonormal contrasts such that the marginal prior on all fixed effects is identical for categorical (nominal and ordinal) predictors (R uses dummy encoding by default). This scheme is used for better interpretability of models with interactions. However, the fixed and random effects estimates will differ from those obtained from R with default settings. We advise using the 'Estimated marginal means' section for obtaining mean estimates at individual factor levels. For comparing the mean estimates, use the contrasts option.\n\nThe analysis uses a long data format.\n\nThe prior distributions are weakly informative and should be well-behaved in parameter estimation settings. The module uses the default prior distribution settings of the rstanarm R package which defines normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5) prior distributions on scaled and centered model coefficients.",

These are typically variables, such as participant or item, one wants to generalize over. Factors with very few levels (i.e., less then five or six levels) should not be used as random effects grouping factors and the number of levels of the random effects grouping factors determines the power of the test of the fixed effects (Westfall, Kenny, & Judd, 2014). The random effect structure (i.e., random intercepts, random slopes, and correlations among random effects parameters) can be specified under `Model` - `Random effects`. The default random effects structure is the automatically determined \"maximal random effects structure justified by the design\" (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013).",
