(Field)\n  - Confidence intervals: Coverage of the confidence intervals in percentages. The default value is 95.\n    - Odds ratio scale: proportionate change in odds by dividing the odds after a unit change in the predictor by the odds before that change (Field)\n  - Robust Standard errors: this option controls for errors that are not independent and identically distributed.

There are three pseudo R2 values calculated in JASP.\n  - McFadden: calculated as one minus the ratio of the log-likelihood of the specified model to the log-likelihood of the null model. If the specified model fits the data relatively better than the null model, McFadden's R2 is close to 1. If the null model fits the data about the same as the specified model, McFadden's R2 is close to 0.\n  - Cox & Snell: calculated as one minus the ratio of the likelihood of the null model to the likelihood of the specified model, with the ratio raised to the power of 2/n (sample size). Higher values indicate that the specified model fits the data relatively better than the null model. However, this index is bounded at one minus the likelihood of the null model raised to the power of 2/n, and under ideal circumstances can be only as high as 0.75.\n  - Nagelkerke: provides a correction to the Cox & Snell R2 so that it is bounded at 1. Specifically, it is calculated as the Cox & Snell R2 divided by one minus the likelihood of the null model raised to the power of 2/n. Values closer to one indicate that the specified model outperforms the null model.\n  - Tjur: calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the mean average predicted value for all cases with zero and the mean average predicted value for all cases with one. Values close to one indicate clear separation between the predicted values for cases with zeros and cases with ones. Unlike the other pseudo R2 indices, Tjur's R2 is not relative to the null model.\n\nCoefficients:\n- Estimate: regression coefficients.\n- (Robust) Standard Error: Standard error of the regression coefficients.\n- Standardized: Standardized regression coefficients.",
