      "text": "Generalized Linear Models\n===\nA generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible extension of ordinary linear regression. A widely used GLM is binary logistic regression. Generally speaking, a GLM consists of a **random component** and a **systematic component**:\n\n- The random component specifies an appropriate probability distribution for the response variable. For example, a binomial distribution is appropriate for proportions of a total.\n- The systematic component specifies how the explanatory variables relate to the mean of the response. For example, in binary logistic regression, the logit link function is used to map the responses (i.e. probabilities) to the linear combination of predictors (i.e. *linear predictor*).",
