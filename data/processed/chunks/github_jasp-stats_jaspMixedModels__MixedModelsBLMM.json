An introduction to this model class and the concepts introduced below is provided in <a href=\"http://singmann.org/download/publications/singmann_kellen-introduction-mixed-models.pdf\">Singmann and Kellen (2019)</a>.",

This scheme is used for better interpretability of models with interactions. However, the fixed and random effects estimates will differ from those obtained from R with default settings. We advise using the 'Estimated marginal means' section for obtaining mean estimates at individual factor levels. For comparing the mean estimates, use the contrasts option.\n\nThe analysis uses a long data format.\n\nThe prior distributions are weakly informative and should be well-behaved in parameter estimation settings. The module uses the default prior distribution settings of the rstanarm R package which defines normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5) prior distributions on scaled and centered model coefficients.",

These are usually the variables of primary scientific interest.\n  - Random effects grouping factors: Categorical variable(s) specifying clusters of observations (i.e., several observations per level of a random effects grouping factor). These are typically variables, such as participant or item, one wants to generalize over. Factors with very few levels (i.e., less then five or six levels) should not be used as random effects grouping factors and the number of levels of the random effects grouping factors determines the power of the test of the fixed effects (Westfall, Kenny, & Judd, 2014). The random effect structure (i.e., random intercepts, random slopes, and correlations among random effects parameters) can be specified under `Model` - `Random effects`. The default random effects structure is the automatically determined \"maximal random effects structure justified by the design\" (Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013).",
