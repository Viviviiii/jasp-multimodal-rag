JASP Manual Ground Truth Q&A Benchmark (~73 Pairs)

==================================================== DATA HANDLING &
BASICS ==================================================== 


Q1: What file types can I import into JASP? A1: JASP can open .jasp, Excel
(.xls/.xlsx), CSV, TXT, TSV, SPSS (.sav, .por), Stata (.dta), SAS
(.sas7bdat, .xpt), and ODS files. (p.2)

Q2: How do I save my JASP project so I can continue later? A2: Use
Save/Save As to store everything (data, annotations, analyses) in JASP’s
.jasp format. (p.3)

Q3: How do I export results from JASP? A3: Results can be exported to
HTML or PDF, and data can be exported to CSV, TSV, or TXT. (p.3)

Q4: Can I change JASP’s appearance? A4: Yes. In Preferences > Interface,
you can choose light or dark theme, adjust zoom, fonts, and language (13
supported). (pp.4–5)

Q5: How do I filter data in JASP? A5: In the spreadsheet view, click the
filter icon to exclude cases. Complex filters are also available. (p.9)

Q6: How does JASP recognize variable types? A6: JASP guesses between
Nominal, Ordinal, and Continuous, but you can click the column icon to
manually adjust. (p.8)

Q7: How can I edit my dataset inside JASP? A7: Click Data Editor to add
or modify cells. Changes sync automatically back unless the file is
renamed. (p.11)

  ----------------------------------------------------
  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS & VISUALIZATION
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Q8: What are the three main measures of central
  tendency reported in JASP? A8: Mean, median, and
  mode. (p.16–17)

  Q9: How is dispersion summarized in JASP
  descriptives? A9: Standard deviation, variance,
  standard error, coefficient of variation, MAD, IQR,
  and confidence intervals. (pp.17–18)

  Q10: How do I split descriptive statistics by groups
  in JASP? A10: Add a categorical variable into the
  Split box. JASP then produces group-wise tables and
  plots. (p.21)

  Q11: What plot shows whether data are normally
  distributed in JASP? A11: The Q–Q plot: if points
  fall along the 45° line, the data are close to
  normal. (p.22)

  violin plot in JASP? A12: A boxplot shows quartiles,
  median, and outliers, while a violin plot overlays a
  smoothed density curve. (p.25)

  Q13: How can I customize a plot in JASP? A13:
  Right-click > Edit Image allows modifying axis
  labels, ranges, and exporting plots as images.

null hypothesis that the sample comes from a normal distribution. (p.35)

Q17: What does Levene’s test tell me in JASP? A17: It tests equality of
variances across groups. If p > .05, homogeneity is assumed. (p.36)

  t-tests? A26: Independence, continuous DV,
  normality, no major outliers, and homogeneity of
  variance. (p.57)

  Q27: How do I interpret an independent samples
  t-test? A27: If Levene’s test is not significant,

+1. Values near ±1 show strong association; near 0 show weak/no
association. (p.69)

Q35: What is R² in correlation analysis? A35: R² is the proportion of
variance explained by the relationship. For r=0.98, R²=96.8%. (p.72)

Q36: What are the non-parametric alternatives to Pearson’s correlation?
A36: Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau. (p.73)

variable increases, the other decreases. (p.69)

  A39: R² shows how much variance in the DV is
  explained by predictors. Higher values = better fit.
  (p.77)

  Q40: How do I interpret regression coefficients in
  JASP? A40: Each coefficient (b) shows the expected
  change in the DV for a 1-unit increase in the
  predictor. (p.79)

  A41: Linearity, normality of residuals,
  homoscedasticity, no multicollinearity, independence

  Q44: What is logistic regression used for in JASP?
  A44: To predict binary outcomes (yes/no) using
  categorical or continuous predictors. (p.88)

  Q45: How do you interpret an odds ratio in logistic
  regression? A45: OR >1 means higher odds, OR <1
  means lower odds of the outcome with that predictor.
  (p.91)

or asymmetry in study effect sizes. (p.162)

Q65: What does I² indicate in meta-analysis? A65: The percentage of
variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance. (p.154)

  ----------------------------------------------------
