Each query is tested under multiple retrieval modes and difficulty levels, so the same query appears multiple times. I want to test whether retrieval mode and difficulty level have main effects or an interaction effect on performance. Given this repeated-measures structure and mixed outcome types, can generalized linear mixed models be used?",difficult,bm_vector_fusion,1.0
